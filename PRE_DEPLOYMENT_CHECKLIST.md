## üöÄ Ready to Deploy?

### Final Steps:

1. **Generate Production JWT Secret**
   ```bash
   # Visit https://passwordsgenerator.net/
   # Generate 32+ character password
   # Save for Vercel env vars
   ```

2. **Verify Environment Variables**
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...?sslmode=verify-full
   JWT_SECRET=[your-new-secret]
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

3. **Test Build Locally**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run start
   # Visit http://localhost:3000
   # Test signup and login
   ```

4. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git status  # Review what will be committed
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Flutter Component Generator"
   git push origin main
   ```

5. **Deploy to Vercel**
   - Import project from GitHub
   - Add environment variables
   - Deploy
   - Visit `/api/setup` once
   - Test authentication

## üéØ Post-Deployment

After deploying, verify:

- [ ] App loads at Vercel URL
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] Database connection works
- [ ] Signup creates user in database
- [ ] Login works with created user
- [ ] Session persists on refresh
- [ ] Export functionality works
- [ ] Both themes work
- [ ] Both languages work
- [ ] Mobile view works

## üêõ If Something Fails

1. **Check Vercel Logs**
   - Dashboard ‚Üí Project ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí View Function Logs

2. **Check Environment Variables**
   - Dashboard ‚Üí Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables

3. **Check Database**
   - Visit CockroachDB console
   - Verify tables exist: `SELECT * FROM users;`

4. **Common Fixes**
   - Re-run `/api/setup` if tables missing
   - Regenerate JWT_SECRET if token errors
   - Verify DATABASE_URL includes `?sslmode=verify-full`

## ‚úÖ All Checks Passed?
